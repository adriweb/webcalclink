# WebUSBTI

This is a crappy PoC showing WebUSB talking to TI calculators.  
Maybe in the future it will get less crappy. We'll see.

## Instructions

- Get a WebUSB-enabled browser (for instance, any recent (57+?) Chrome)
- Plug your TI calculator (any device with the DBUS(/CARS) protocol should be OK)
- Authorize access to it
- Do stuff

## Credits

- Thanks to Lionel Debroux for all the calc protocol stuff (see [libti*](https://github.com/debrouxl/tilibs/))
- Inspired from [yubikey-webusb](https://github.com/SantiagoTorres/yubikey-webusb)
